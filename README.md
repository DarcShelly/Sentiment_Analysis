Sentiment Analysis with CNN
## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis model using deep learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. This project aims to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
### What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a text. It is widely used in various applications such as:

Social Media Monitoring: Understanding public opinion about products, brands, or events.
Customer Feedback Analysis: Analyzing reviews to gauge customer satisfaction.
Market Research: Assessing consumer sentiment towards competitors or market trends.
Political Analysis: Tracking sentiment around political events or figures.
By extracting sentiments from text data, businesses and researchers can gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
### Role of Deep Learning in Sentiment Analysis
Deep learning has significantly advanced the field of sentiment analysis by providing powerful models that can capture complex patterns in text data. Traditional machine learning methods often require extensive feature engineering and are limited in their ability to handle large-scale data. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly those based on neural networks, can automatically learn features from raw text data, enabling more accurate and scalable sentiment analysis.

Key deep learning techniques include:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Suitable for sequential data, RNNs can capture temporal dependencies in text.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: A type of RNN that can remember long-term dependencies, making them effective for sentiment analysis.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Typically used in image processing, CNNs can also be applied to text data to identify local patterns.
Transformers: State-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT, which leverage attention mechanisms to understand context and relationships in text.

In this project, we focus specifically on CNN models for sentiment analysis.

### Database
Any machine learning model is only as good as its database permits it. Choosing a database for our project proved to be a challenging task, as we wished to predict not only the polarity behind the text but also the emotionâ€”such as joy, sadness, neutral, etc. This requirement for a broader prediction range eliminated many of the top text databases available on Kaggle.

We chose to go forward with the dataset [Text with Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divu2001/text-with-sentiment), which contains unprocessed tweet texts mapped to their sentiments. This dataset provides a rich variety of sentiments, allowing our model to learn and predict a wide range of emotional responses.
